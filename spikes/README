The only difference between A and B is that the uncertainty in 9 pixels have been increased for object 5

If you run A (with larger pixel uncertainty for 9 pixels) it will work in parallel or serial

If you run B (original, no changes) it will fail at object 5 (42_0_14) in parallel and serial.

Use ferre.x as normal or ferre.verbose.x for verbose executable
